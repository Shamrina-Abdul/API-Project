makefile
Copy code
web: node app.js
Initialize Git Repository:

Initialize a Git repository and commit your code:

bash
Copy code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Heroku Deployment:

If you haven't already, sign up for a Heroku account and install the Heroku CLI. Then, log in to Heroku using the CLI:

bash
Copy code
heroku login
Create a Heroku app:

bash
Copy code
heroku create your-app-name
Deploy your app to Heroku:

bash
Copy code
git push heroku master
Access Your API:

Once the deployment is complete, you can access your API using the generated Heroku URL (e.g., https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/bfhl). You can use tools like Postman or cURL to test your endpoints.

That's it! You've created a REST API with the specified endpoints, and it's hosted on Heroku. Make sure to add proper error handling, input validation, and other best practices as needed for your specific use case.
